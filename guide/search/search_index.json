For the first visualization, use different color for each cell and paint inside the cell region. For the second visualization, plot only cell contours on the image. Cluster cells (with k-means) into three classes according to their sizes. Use a different color for each cluster for visualization.

Do not loose your motivation even if it takes too long time to finish It will not be so easy in the first place but it will get easier! \u2192 Select your deep learning library ( list ). Be sure that you can play with simple examples like MNIST , Fashion-MNIST , and CIFAR with different CNN architectures (i.e. Alexnet, Resnet, VGG, etc.). For example, you can Display images Try different hyperparameters Try different losses Try different optimizers Use augmentation Add more layers Remove some layers If you haven't done yet, try to visualize (plot) train/validation/test losses. Ask Google and use the links on this webpage. The homework is about classification of texture images cropped from knee joint x rays. Cropped images are of size 64x64 (grayscale) They were cropped from the medial tibia from two different sites as shown below: A sample image and the cropped region (datasetA) A sample image and the cropped region (datasetB) Crops from right and left knee We have two different datasets (from OAI ) Download datasetA Download datasetB Warning Do not share/distribute the data! Name of the file is {id}.py . ID corresponds to subject identity. Each file is a numpy array. Each array has the following items: [ patches , id ] and patches is a dictionary such that there are two images (one from Right knee the other is from Left knee belonging to the same id ). You can use the following code snippet to read the file in python: import numpy as np from PIL import Image import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #read a file patches , p_id = np . load ( fname ) #get right image right_image = Image . fromarray ( patches [ 'R' ] . astype ( 'uint8' ), 'L' ) #left image left_image = Image . fromarray ( patches [ 'L' ] . astype ( 'uint8' ), 'L' ) #display them fig , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , 2 ) ax [ 0 ] . imshow ( right_image ) ax [ 1 ] . imshow ( left_image ) plt . show () Each image is graded with a KL score (although you are supposed to be familiar with this (i.e. OA related material on the webpage ), if you are not familiar read below for a short introduction.) KL grading (click to expand) #from https://radiopaedia.org/articles/kellgren-and-lawrence-system-for-classification-of-osteoarthritis-of-knee The Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) system is a common method of classifying the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) using five grades 1. This classification was proposed by Kellgren et al. in 1957 2 and later accepted by WHO in 1961. In applying the system, the prevalence of chronic knee pain in a postal survey of 2000 Swedes aged 35-54 was 15%1. Of these respondents, 1% showed radiographic knee OA, based on bilateral weight bearing plain films1. Classification grade 0: no radiographic features of OA are present grade 1: doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping grade 2: definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph grade 3: multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity grade 4: large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity The grades are stored in this following file baseline.csv . It is a table that shows different measures and outcomes for each id . Details about image assessment can be found here . Use pandas to read that ( .csv ) file and check the following colums for KL grading: 'ID' : subject ID 'V00XRKL' : grade 'SIDE' : side ( 1 : right , 2 : left ) There are 5 different grades: 0,1,2,3,4. Use following labels for multi-class classification Class 1: Grade0 , Class 2: Grade1 Class 3: Grade2 Class 4: Grade3 Class 5: Grade4 For binary classification, you can combine grades<2 and grades>1 : Class 1: Grade0, Grade1 Class 2: Grade2, Grade3, Grade4 If you are not familiar with pandas library read from here , here , here , here , here , or Google it! Things to do Now your task is to classify images using CNN. You are free to choose your architecture(s) State-of-the-art architectures You can also design your own architecture (strongly recommended) Test both binary classification and multi-class classification. Train and test datasetA and datasetB independently Use both R and L images but keep the two sides from the same id in the same fold ( train , test , validation ). For this, use pandas dataframes together with GroupKFold splitting from scikit-learn . Use 5-fold cross-validation ROC AUC score for evaluation Train on datasetA and test on datasetB For evaluation of binary classification, use both ROC and precision-recall curves and AUC and F1 score. Read : https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/ Train on datasetB and test on datasetA For evaluation of binary classification, use both ROC and precision-recall curves and AUC and F1 score. Send me only the curves (ROC and Precision-Recall) and numbers (AUC, F1) For GPU you can use the CSC cluster: https://research.csc.fi/taito-gpu Note (click to expand) I did not use this service before, therefore, I don't know the details please check from the web page.
